A 'Simple Task System' application built with ASP.NET Boilerplate.

This is the most complete example project. Includes three web projects:

* One uses **AngularJs** as frontend framework and **EntityFramework** as ORM.
* One uses **DurandalJs** as frontend framework and **Nhibernate** as ORM.
* And a console application (SimpleTaskSystem.ConsoleApp) to simply show how to bootstrap ABP and use an application service in a Console application.

All projects share same Domain ve Application layers. Sample projects are documented in detail in these Codeproject articles:

* Angular&EF version: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/791740/Using-AngularJs-ASP-NET-MVC-Web-API-and-EntityFram
* Durandal&NH version: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768664/Introduction-to-ASP-NET-Boilerplate
* Unit Testing for this project: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/871786/Unit-testing-in-Csharp-using-xUnit-Entity-Framewor
